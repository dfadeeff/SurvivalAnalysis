This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#Install library
library(survival)



mydata <- read.csv("Stages_Pivot_new.csv", header = T)


mydata_subset <- mydata[c(17,18,19,20,21,22)]

#Eliminate NAs
mydata_subset = na.omit(mydata_subset)

attach(mydata_subset)

#Here I take median order frequency, for the total group, it`s around 33 days
time <- days_since_firstorder
event <- churn_ind

#Basic setup 
survival <- Surv(time,event == 1)

#Fit survival curve by gender
fit_gender <- survfit(survival ~ female, data = mydata_subset)

#Fit survival curve by city
fit_city <- survfit(survival ~ berlin, data = mydata_subset)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Plot curve by gender
plot(fit_gender, lty = 1:2, mark.time = FALSE, ylim = c(0.3,1), xlab = "Days since first order", ylab = "Survival probability")
legend(20,0.8,c('Male','Female'),lty=1:2,bty='n',ncol=2)

#Plot curve by city
plot(fit_city, lty = 1:2, mark.time = FALSE, ylim = c(0.3,1), xlab = "Days since first order", ylab = "Survival probability")
legend(20,0.8,c('London','Berlin'),lty=1:2,bty='n',ncol=2)
title(main="Survival curve by city")

```


```{r,eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Log rank by gender
survdiff(survival ~ female, data=mydata_subset)

#Log rank by city
